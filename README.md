# üöÄ Galerie - Stellar NFT Marketplace

> Revolutionizing digital art ownership through Stellar blockchain technology

---

## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 12 ‚Äì Implementing Stellar Technologies**

---

## üéØ Objective

Galerie addresses the challenge of accessible and efficient NFT creation and trading on the Stellar blockchain. Traditional NFT platforms often have high gas fees and technical barriers, making them inaccessible to many artists and collectors.

Our marketplace provides a user-friendly platform for artists to tokenize their digital art as NFTs on Stellar's energy-efficient blockchain with minimal fees. For collectors, we offer a curated marketplace to discover, collect, and trade unique digital assets while ensuring proper attribution and royalties for creators.

## Environment Variables and Security

This project uses environment variables for configuration. We've provided a `.env.example` file that shows the required variables.

### Setting up Pinata for IPFS Storage

1. Create an account on [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud)
2. Generate API keys from the Pinata dashboard
3. Add these keys to your `.env` file:
   ```
   REACT_APP_PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
   REACT_APP_PINATA_API_SECRET=your_pinata_api_secret
   ```

### Troubleshooting Pinata Issues

If you encounter issues with Pinata uploads:

1. Verify your API keys are correct in the `.env` file
2. Check that your Pinata account has sufficient storage space
3. Ensure your network connection is stable
4. Check the browser console for specific error messages
5. Try regenerating your Pinata API keys if problems persist

For Stellar blockchain integration, make sure your Stellar account has sufficient funds for transactions.
