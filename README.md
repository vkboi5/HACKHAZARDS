To test as a telegram mini app, install cloudflare extension on VSCode and start it to obtain public accessible URL , use that URL to setup the telegram mini app through
bot.js file or through botfather.

Also we have deployed our smart contracts on sepolia testnet so
the marketplace and other functionalities would work on this testnet or on default hardhat network.

Hopefully your telegram mini app should start without any errors! 

Check out our telegram mini app: [Click here!](https://t.me/Galeries_Telegram_Mini_App_Bot) 
//If you are accessing app through telegram please note that sometimes connecting to wallet and making transactions will be
tough and time-consuming , so patience is a key here!
